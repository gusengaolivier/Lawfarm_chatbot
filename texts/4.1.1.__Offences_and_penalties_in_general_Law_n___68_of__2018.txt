CHAPTER ONE: NATURAL PERSONS


Section One: Criminal liability

Article 83: Criminal liability and its occurrence

Criminal	liability	is	incurred	by	the

offender, his/her co-offender or accomplice.

Only a person who intentionally commits an offence is punishable. However, if the

88
Official Gazette no. Special of 27/09/2018


law so provides, a person commits an offence as a result of his/her recklessness, clumsiness, negligence or any other form of carelessness.

Article 84: Punishment of a co-offender and an accomplice

The co-offender incurs the same penalties as the offender.

The accomplice does not incur the same penalties as the offender except where:

1º	the law provides otherwise;

2º	the judge, in his/her discretion, finds that the accomplice’s responsibility in the commission of the offence is the same as or greater than that of the principal offender.

The accomplice may be prosecuted even if the criminal action cannot be instituted against the offender due to reasons particularly specific to the offender such as death, insanity or his/her being unidentified.

However, when a person referred to in items 5 d), 5 e) and 5 f) of Article 2 of this Law is the offender’s spouse or relative up to the fourth (4th) degree, the court may exempt him/her from the penalties prescribed for the accomplice.

A person who deliberately deprives himself/herself of mental faculties during the commission of an offence is criminally liable, even if such deprivation was not intended to commit an offence.


Article 86: Grounds for exemption from criminal liability

Grounds for exemption from criminal liability that are inherent to the offender are admitted if :

1º	a person commits an offence under the effect of a force or under duress to such an extent that he/she cannot resist;

2º	a person commits an act under orders of a legitimate authority, unless such an act is evidently unlawful;





90

3º	a person commits an offence as a result of an error of law or an error of fact if such an error entirely removes the intention to commit an offence;

1º	a person acts in self-defence in the following cases:

    a) fending off a person who breaks into or enters by force or trickery an inhabited place;

    b) defends himself/herself against thieves or other wrongdoers;

2º	a person commits the following acts:

    a) an act of self-defence in case of danger;


    b) an act of defending another person in danger;

The exemption of criminal liability due to the grounds referred to under Paragraph 2

91
Official Gazette no. Special of 27/09/2018


of this Article is only admitted if the means used by the offender to ensure self-defence or protect himself/herself or another person from danger or interrupt damage to the property he/she protected are proportional to the gravity of the threat.

The grounds for non-criminal liability and grounds for exemption from criminal liability that are inherent to the offender do not apply with respect to his/her co-offenders or accomplices.

Nor do such grounds entail exemption from civil liability, if necessary.
